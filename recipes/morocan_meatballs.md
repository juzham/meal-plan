# Moroccan Meatballs

## Ingredients

- 500g beef mince 
- 1 red onion 
- 2 cm piece ginger, peeled and grated 
- 1 clove of garlic, crushed 
- 1 red chilli, deseeded and finely chopped (REMOVED FROM RECIPE)
- 400g canned chopped tomatoes 
- 120g cherry tomatoes, halved 
- fresh continental parsley, roughly chopped 
- 1 cup couscous 

## Instructions

1. Make the meatballs
In a bowl, combine the mince, onion, ginger, garlic, chilli and cumin. Season to taste. Roll the mixture into balls, 1 tablespoon at a time.
2. Cook the meatballs
Heat the oil in a non-stick frying pan on medium. Cook the meatballs, turning occasionally until browned. Stir in canned tomatoes. Add water along with cherry tomatoes. Add fresh parsley and stir.
3. Simmer
Bring to the boil then reduce heat to low. Simmer, uncovered, for 15-20 minutes, or until meatballs are cooked through and the sauce thickens.
4. Cook couscous
Meanwhile, place the couscous in a large bowl and cover with the same amount of boiling water. Cover and set aside for 5 minutes. Fluff couscous with a fork to separate grains.
5. Chargrill zucchini
Heat a chargrill pan on high. Add zucchini and cook for a few minutes each side until you achieve good chargrill marks. Remove from the heat.
6. Serve
Serve meatballs on a bed of couscous and a side of grilled zucchini.
